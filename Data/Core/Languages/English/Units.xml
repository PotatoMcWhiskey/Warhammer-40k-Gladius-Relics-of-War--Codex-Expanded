	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/BasiliskFlavor" value="When the Imperial Guard go to war, they march to the thunderous report of batteries of Basilisks whose guns can flatten cities and end worlds.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ImperialStrongpointDescription" value="Stationary fortification unit."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ImperialStrongpointFlavor" value="An Imperial Bastion is an imposing edifice built from foot-thick ferrocrete and the remains of faithful servants of the Imperium. As they are relatively easy to construct, some planets boast networks of Bastions that span entire continents. Built to withstand orbital strikes and artillery bombardments, there are few weapons capable of razing them in a single blow. It is with good reason that such fortresses often form the cornerstone of a planet's defensive strategy."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/LemanRussBattleTankFlavor" value="The Leman Russ battle tank is an ironclad declaration of might made manifest.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/MarauderBomberFlavor" value="Sturdily built and boasting a colossal payload for its size, the Marauder is the archetypal heavy bomber of the Imperium.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/PrimarisPsykerFlavor" value="Loathed and feared as witches by their superstitious comrades, Primaris Psykers are nonetheless valuable assets to any commander.

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/WyrdvanePsykerFlavor" value="Wyrdvane Psykers transform the howling might of the Warp into a deadly weapon of Imperial supremacy. They are formed from those Scholastica Psykana inductees not able to control their burgeoning powers without guidance and aid. As individuals, such psykers are unpredictable and unsafe. Yet working in concert, these deadly mutants can be a valuable asset."/>
	<entry name="CompendiumFlavor" value="Reading the histories of the 41st millenium, one might assume that the galaxy only experiences conflict. That's far from the truth -- most civilians of the Imperium live and die in peace. Yet to be conscripted into an Imperial army is almost a guarantee of death in wars against foul creatures far from your homeworld, in order that the majority of the Imperium can continue to exist in peace."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/AnnihilationBargeFlavor" value="Annihilation Barges are the Necrons' favoured anti-infantry support platforms. At the Overlord's command, the Annihilation Barges' ancient repulsor sleds are coaxed back into life and the vehicles accompany the tomb world's army to war.

	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekScarabFlavor" value="Canoptek Scarabs sweep across the battlefield in vast, undulating swarms that devour all in their path. Mindless feeding machines, the Scarabs are constructs designed to break down matter into raw energy that can then be woven into fresh forms. Within the confines of a tomb this process is one of clearing and manufacture, but on the battlefield it is a powerful force of destruction."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekSpyderDescription" value="Monstrous support unit that founds new cities."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CanoptekSpyderFlavor" value="Though essentially an automated drone, a Canoptek Spyder is nonetheless a formidable foe. Its vast array of self-repair and backup systems -- vital for enduring uncaring millennia -- offer substantial protection against incoming fire. In return, any enemy that strays within reach of the Canoptek Spyder will have flesh scoured from bone by a multitude of mechanical tools and pincers."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/CryptekDescription" value="Hero unit with powerful support abilities."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CryptekFlavor" value="Crypteks bend the forces of the universe to their will, creating impossible technologies and esoteric weaponry to lay waste to armies and destroy worlds. Time, matter and space are their playthings, as they manipulate the atomic structure of their foes or shift the laws of nature to obliterate all who stand before them."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerLordDescription" value="Hero unit with exceptional close combat capabilities."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerLordFlavor" value="Destroyer Lords are the most maniacal of their kind. This is chiefly because they retain far more intellect than baseline Destroyers, and can bring all of this fearsome intelligence to bear in their pursuit of universal oblivion. Indeed, in a galaxy overspilling with genocidal despots, Destroyer Lords remain worthy of mention as something truly horrific. Where others kill for pleasure, or in service to some malignant god, Destroyer Lords pursue their bloody crusade simply because they can."/>

These supersonic fighter craft range ahead of a Necron army, drawing upon their strategic datastacks to operate with virtual autonomy.

	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayArkFlavor" value="Victory through overwhelming firepower is a common tenet of Necron strategic thinking. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Doomsday Ark. Though deceptively fragile at first glance, the Doomsday Ark is a self-propelled energy cannon whose raw, unsubtle firepower is so vastly destructive that a single shot can turn the tide of a battle."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerDescription" value="Powerful anti-armour infantry unit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerFlavor" value="Armed with oversized gauss cannons, Heavy Destroyers send blazing energy blasts searing across the battlefield. These heavily armed adherents of the Destroyer Cults glide across scorched earth scanning for victims, the flickering light of their weapons' energy cores echoing the cold hatred in their optics. When a Heavy Destroyer's targeting lens focuses upon an enemy, the battlefield recedes in its mind until only hunter and prey remain, the compulsion to kill drowning out everything else."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/LordDescription" value="Iconic hero unit with versatile abilities."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/LordFlavor" value="These Lords of the Necrons, though lesser in stature and power than an Overlord or phaeron, are nonetheless formidable foes in their own right, and often march to war at the head of a vast mechanical army.

	<entry name="Necrons/NightScytheFlavor" value="The Night Scythe is the Necrons' favoured tool of invasion, a sickle-winged herald of woe that possesses the ability to beam Necrons directly into battle. Manoeuvrable enough to evade orbital defences and interceptors, and swift enough to outpace mustering foes, Night Scythes can ghost through a defence perimeter to deploy invasion forces well behind enemy lines."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/ObeliskFlavor" value="The Obelisk hovers low over the battlefield, the somnolent hum of its gravitic repulsors sowing dread in the hearts of the foe. As it drifts into view, black lightning arcing across its glowing hull, the Obelisk presents a darkly majestic sight. Yet wonder turns swiftly to horror as the Obelisk's weapons cycle up, glowing tesla spheres irising open to spit crawling skeins of lightning that reduce those nearby to blackened, twitching husks."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/TranscendentCtanFlavor" value="Transcendent C'tan are all that remain of the once mighty star-gods. They are echoes of their former selves, splinters of energy that survived the Necrons' betrayal and were trammelled in tesseract labyrinths. Ancient, archaic technologies shackle these beings to the will of their Necron masters, compelling them to obey and reducing them to the merest echoes of their ancient majesty. Yet even in their reduced and fettered state, Transcendent C'tan are still beings of immense power."/>

These machines are walking relics from aeons past, and all the deadlier for it -- the air nearby thrums with power, bullets ricocheting from repulsor fields that glow like golden cages around them. Volleys of phosphor blasts and promethium incinerate their foes wherever they may hide, and crushing fists bring ruin wherever they strike.

Its devastating guns reduce swathes of victims to ruin, drowning them in jets of red-hot gore or burying them under rains of gnashing skulls. As it ploughs through the enemy ranks, the Daemon Engine wields its roaring cleaver with a speed and skill that is entirely horrifying in something so huge. Entire ranks of enemy warriors are swept away with a single swing, tanks and monstrous beasts swatted through the air like toys. Even towering war engines such as Stompas or Titans are made to look clumsy and sluggish as the Lord of Skulls hacks off their limbs and tears open their armoured torsos amid blossoms of dirty flame.

Though not as nimble as the aircraft of some other races, Dakkajets are capable of an incredible turn of speed that makes them a fearsome enemy to face in aerial combat. It also helps that Orks fly like complete headcases."/>

	<entry name="Orks/DeffkoptaFlavor" value="Deffkoptas buzz across the battlefield, weaving through the sky on a trail of foul-smelling smoke. As they swoop low over the heads of the enemy, the fiendish Ork flying machines fire punishing salvoes of shot, rokkits and bomms into their midst. Leaving flames and blood-splattered craters in their wake, the Deffkoptas jink erratically away, already hunting for their next victims."/>

	<entry name="Orks/GargantuanSquiggothFlavor" value="Squiggoths are Orkoid monstrosities, towering hulks made of little more than muscle and bad temper. They are distantly related to Squigs and have all savagery and single-mindedness of their smaller cousins, but Squiggoths can grow so large that they dwarf tanks and even buildings. Goaded by the Orks that ride on a howdah upon its back, the Squiggoth thuds into battle, the ground tremblind beneath its feet."/>

	<entry name="Orks/GorkanautFlavor" value="A Gorkanaut is everything an Ork aspires to be. Massive, tough, loud and destructive, its blocky silhouette looms menacingly over friend and foe alike. From its hulking, orkoid shape to the brutal weapons it wields, a Gorkanaut epitomises the unsubtle brutality of Gork and his no-nonsense way of war. Every Gorkanaut is essentially a massively overbuilt armoured war suit bristling with dakka and packing an armoured claw the size of a Killa Kan."/>

	<entry name="Orks/KillaKanFlavor" value="The Killa Kans' grot pilots put their relative skill with firearms to good use, blowing the zog out of anything unlucky enough to cross their path. Despite being hardwired into a ten-foot tall killing machine, Killa Kan pilots still retain a good degree of Gretchin cowardice. As a result they still believe in safety in numbers, and have a bad habit of losing their nerve under fire. It is not unheard of for Killa Kans to waddle about in circles or freeze up entirely at the first sign of danger."/>

	<entry name="Orks/MeganobFlavor" value="The richest and most battle-hardened Nobz can become Meganobz by paying a Mek to build them a suit of mega armour. Piston-driven and covered in enough protective plating to turn its wearer into a walking tank, this armour is incredibly expensive. Yet it serves as the ultimate greenskin status symbol. Though other Orks mock the Meganobz for wearing so much armour, only the dullest would do so within earshot. Even a direct hit from a tank round is unlikely to do more than knock a Meganob over, worsening his already foul temper. For many, the only chance of surviving an encounter with an angry Meganob is to outrun him."/>

	<entry name="Orks/MekFlavor" value="Without Mekboyz, Orks would lack for light, power, transport, and even guns (they lack for sanitation regardless, but that's another story). Whenever an Ork needs something building, be it a shiny new shoota or the boss' new ride, they go straight to the Meks. Furthermore, an Ork with teef to spare will take existing kit to the nearest Mek in the hope of having damage repaired, and maybe some kustomising done. It is a rare day that the customer gets what he asked for, but whatever the Mek turns out will normally be fairly flash all the same."/>

Spitting out blasts of crackling energy, swatting planes out of the air or crushing their victims in crackling fists of bright green force, these big, clanky field guns have enough dakka to stomp even the toughest targets. Of course, as no self-respecting Ork would be left behind when there's a fight in the offing, crewing the gunz is left to the long-suffering grots."/>

	<entry name="Orks/PainboyFlavor" value="Often referred to by other Orks as Doks, Painboyz are the greenskin equivalent of both surgeons and dentists. They are driven to perform exploratory surgery on living creatures just as Mekboyz are driven to fiddle with machinery. Devious, deranged, and usually covered in gore from head to toe, Painboyz are a menace to friend and foe alike."/>

	<entry name="Orks/WarbossFlavor" value="An Ork Warboss is the strongest, toughest, loudest and most violent Ork in his tribe. These massive greenskins seize the lion's share of the loot from every fight, meaning they are usually armed and armoured better than any of their followers. Warbosses are not above making a swift and messy example of anyone whose kit seems shinier or more killy than theirs. They wield absolute authority over their tribe, for greenskin society is based on the idea that might makes right."/>

	<entry name="Orks/WarbuggyFlavor" value="Orks tend toward light, fast vehicles with big guns that can be cobbled together from any junk to hand. Most are crewed by a mad-eyed Ork driver and cackling gunner, with perhaps a grot or two hanging on for dear life. What they lack in survivability, these crude vehicles make up for in speed, numbers and dakka. They encircle the enemy in speeding squadrons, guns blazing wildly while their crew throw their heads back and howl like Madboyz."/>

	<entry name="Orks/WeirdboyFlavor" value="Weirdboyz are the most psychically attuned of all Orks. They are capable of vomiting blasts of Warp energy that can reduce foes to molten goop in seconds. Weirdboyz unconsciously channel the background mental emissions of nearby greenskins. Even a close-run squig-eating contest between two rowdy Boyz will cause waves of energy to pulse through any Weirdboy that strays near. Unless the Weirdboy finds some way to release this pent-up energy his head will explode, detonating the heads of nearby Orks into the bargain. This can prove highly inconvenient."/>

	<entry name="SpaceMarines/ApothecaryFlavor" value="These courageous field-surgeons face the full heat of battle, their nartheciums healing even grievous injuries, and their vials of combat stimms and anticoagulants quickly getting wounded brothers back into the fight.

Plunging from the sky with bolt pistols blazing, they slam into their foes like a hurricane of destruction. Screaming victims are thrown to the ground, bodies crushed beneath ceramite boots, chests ripped open by snarling chainswords. Within moments the killing is done, and the Assault Marines bound onwards, leaving behind them a ragged wound torn in the enemy's battle line."/>

Each is virtually impervious to conventional firepower and the lower levels, bunker annexes and sub-crypts can house entire platoons of battle-ready warriors.

Emitting a piercing scream as it tears across the firmament, each of these sacred rounds seeks out the skyborne foes of the Emperor.
